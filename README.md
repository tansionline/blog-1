# blog

welcome to my blog. it doesn't have a link yet tho, let me show you around.


## using

this project can be used to make your own blog. just change the __cfg.js__ a bit
and maybe touch to files in __meta/__ for styling and stuff.

but first, you need to install the packages. i prefer yarn so:

```
$ yarn
```

then compile the posts into html:

```
$ node bc
```

then you can view the home page by:

```
$ firefox posts/index.html
```

you can make a new post with:

```
$ ./mgr n posts
```

and clear compiled files with

```
$ ./mgr c
```


## bugs and feature requests

this thing is so small it __mustn't__ have any bugs in it, besides i want to
remove stuff not add so only the requests that remove code will be considered.


## philosophy

it's unix, everybody got that already i assume.
