# blog

welcome to my blog. it doesn't have a link yet tho, let me show you around.


## using

this project can be used to make your own blog. first you need `marked` command available for this to work. then compile the posts into html:

```
$ ./mgr
```

you can make a new post with:

```
$ ./mgr n posts
```

and clear compiled posts with

```
$ ./mgr c
```


## bugs and feature requests

this thing is so small it __mustn't__ have any bugs in it, besides i want to
remove stuff not add so only the PR's that remove code will be considered.


## philosophy

it's unix, everybody got that already i assume.
